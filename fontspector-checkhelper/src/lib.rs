//! Checks in fontspector are made up of two parts: the implementation,
//! which is a Rust function, and metadata: the check's ID, rationale,
//! proposal URL(s) and so on. This crate provides a procedural macro to
//! help associate the metadata with the implementation.
//!
//! To write a fontspector check, you need to implement a function that
//! takes a `Testable` and a `Context` as arguments (for checks which operate
//! on a single font) or a `TestableCollection` and a `Context`. You
//! then decorate the function with the `#[check(...)]` macro, passing
//! the metadata as arguments. The macro will generate the necessary
//! code to associate the metadata with the implementation.
//!
//! A function which takes a `TestableCollection` should have the argument
//! `implementation = "all"` in the `#[check(...)]` attribute. This will
